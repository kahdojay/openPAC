## Concept
In 2012, super PACs spent a billion dollars; seventy-three percent of the money came from a hundred people.

The problem: a republican democracy is meaningless when only big-dollar candidates make it past the primaries. In other words, when the money is doing the nominating, elections donâ€™t mean much. As stated by demos.org, it is profoundly anti-democratic for anyone to be able to purchase political power.

Another problem: donating to one legislator subscribes to their entire policy base, including other policies you may not know about or actually oppose.

Why this happens: Becoming well-informed and taking collective action is _hard_.

openPAC is a platform where a user can easily find out which legislators support the issues he/she cares about and easily make a donation to that cause, diversified across those legislators (as opposed to giving it all to one politician). To do this, openPAC provides two types of data:
- legislators' relative positions on the issue (in terms of left/right) based on quantitative data
- user-generated 'stances' that express an opinion regarding which legislators support a given position

openPAC is an open-source mission to make the government dependent on the people alone. We welcome all feedback and contributions.
